## Notes & Questions

1. Percentages
	* add a % at the end or leave it a number?

2. JSON files are updated with 
	1. full box scores separated by team column label
	2. separate team JSON files

3. All "Basic Stats" are available and readily able to be gathered. 
	* includes team assists, rebounds, pts in paint, 2nd chance pts, bench pts, pts off tov

# Data file notes:
* players have 3 files
	1. `players_full_box_score.json` has both teams in one file
	2. the other two files starting with `players_` are only spurs or opponent files

* team box scores follow the same convention

# For Vlad
* Look over data files and see if the formatting is okay. 
* Let me know if you want me to rename anything.
	
# Follow-up notes on box scores - **VLAD, you can ignore the following**

# To-do

1. Parse rotations data: player time in, player time out (figure out format with Vlad first)
2. Shot chart data only needs to be in regions

# Shot charts:

1. Game by game shot charts
2. Team shot charts
