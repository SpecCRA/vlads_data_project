## Notes & Questions

1. Naming convention
	* Box_SAS_Player1_Name and Box_OPP_Player1_Name is rather difficult to manage in one table
	* solutions:
		1. two JSON files, one for spurs stats, second for opponent stats
		2. sort your data populator to have a team field and sort that way

2. Outputs
	* Should percentages have decimal points? 
	* If so, how many?
	* For team stats, am I only reporting totals? 
	* How many seasons do you want these statistics to go back?
